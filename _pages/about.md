I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Dalhousie University since January 2024, with my advisor [Dr.Frank Rudzicz](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~rudzicz/). My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, with experience in agentic AI, deep learning, federated learning, and speech recognition. I am a recipient of the [Killam Doctoral Scholarship](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/finance-your-studies/scholarships-bursaries/killam-master-doctoral.html), one of Canada’s most prestigious graduate awards, granted annually to only 20–25 students nationwide. My research is also supported by the [Vector Institute]( https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

I investigate how AI agents interpret and interact with humans or other agents, and how these interactions can be made more reliable and secure. I explore techniques like intention inference, representation learning, and multimodal analysis to improve model transparency and prevent unintended behaviours in agentic systems. The goal of my work is to support the development of AI systems that are safe, responsible, and reliable for deployment in our daily lives, as well as in sensitive domains such as healthcare and public services.

Besides academics, I am currently the president of the Dalhousie Chinese Students and Scholars Association (DCSSA), where I am responsible for organizing and hosting events for the Chinese community at Dalhousie. I’m also a painter with more than 10 years of experience, an amateur designer, and a singer.
