I have started my graduate study in Computer Science at Dalhousie since January 2024 with my supervisor [Dr.Frank Rudzicz](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~rudzicz/), with holding a Bachelor’s degree with Honours in Computer Science. I specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, including hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, speech recognition and sentiment analysis, particularly in the context of healthcare. As one of the graduate student researchers, my research will be supported by the [Vector Institute]( https://vectorinstitute.ai/) as well. 

The primary objective of my research is using federated learning to develop innovative methods for predicting neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, while addressing vulnerabilities in the current FL algorithms that might cause data leakage.

Besides academics, I am currently the president of the Dalhousie Chinese Students and Scholars Association (DCSSA), where I am responsible for organizing and hosting events for the Chinese community at Dalhousie. I'm also a painter with more than 10 years of experience, an amateur designer, and a singer.

If you are interested in my research, or just curious about me, feel free to contact me via xijie.zeng@dal.ca.
